At the heart of the Virtual Deep Deuce project lies a profound commitment to preserving the
essence of Oklahoma City's historic Deep Deuce District, an area once teeming with life and culture,
now remembered only through scattered narratives and memories. This initiative leverages
immersive virtual reality technology platforms designed by Droneâ€™s Eye View (DEV) to resurrect a
neighborhood once vibrant with culture and community, but lost to the tides of urban renewal. The project, inspired by the visionary guidance of
Librarian Judith Matthews, is not merely a technical feat; it is a heartfelt tribute to an Oklahoma City
treasure tragically lost. By weaving archival recordings and oral histories into the fabric of the
virtual environment, DEV aims to offer an immersive educational experience that honors the
district's legacy. The urgency of this mission is underscored by the dwindling number of individuals
who experienced Deep Deuce firsthand, making this project a crucial bridge between past and
present generations.
